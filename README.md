# React-seo-meta

**react-seo-meta** is a React component library designed to simplify the management of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and metadata for React applications. This library enables developers to dynamically set and manage essential metadata on their web pages, which is crucial for improving search engine rankings and enhancing the appearance of web pages when shared on social media.

## Features

- **Dynamic Title Management**: Easily set and update the HTML document's `<title>` element for each page. The title is displayed on the browser tab and is a key element in SEO.
  
- **Meta Description**: Configure the `<meta name="description">` tag, which provides a brief summary of the page's content. Search engines often display this description in search results, making it important for attracting users.

- **Canonical URLs**: Manage the `<link rel="canonical">` tag to specify the preferred version of a web page URL. This helps prevent duplicate content issues by indicating which URL should be considered the authoritative source.

- **Open Graph Tags**: Optimize social media sharing with customizable Open Graph (OG) metadata. OG tags like `<meta property="og:title">`, `<meta property="og:description">`, and `<meta property="og:image">` improve how your content appears when shared on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

- **Lightweight and Easy to Integrate**: The library is designed to be minimalistic and straightforward to use, requiring only a few lines of code to get started. This ensures a smooth integration process with minimal overhead.
